# sw2_0
Software 2.0 is about comparing programing using a Software 1.0 paradigm and a Software 2.0 paradigm regarding complexity, understandability + having fun coding.

Inpired by a Andrej Karpathy [text](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) and tutoring sessions with my supervisors I thought of posing a few peogramming challanges to my collegues or anyone else that want to solva pussles and discuss pros and cons.

The first challenge that I recon is a problem that can be solved either using a traditional software 1.0 paradigm using Python, Java c++ etc or can be solved using Machine learning.

Challenge 1:+-
In this file there are locations represented by latitude and longitude and journeys (consiting of id for origin and destination)*. There exists a correlation between locations and journeys. Write a program that based on the information in the [first traning file] outputs the correct journeys given the locations in this second test file [file]().

**The first 5 numbers in a journey is the id for a origin station in [Sk√•ne/Sweden](http://labs.skanetrafiken.se/) and the last 5 is id for destination.*
