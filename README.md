Software 2.0 is about comparing programing using a Software 1.0 paradigm and a Software 2.0 paradigm regarding complexity, understandability + having fun coding.

Inpired by a Andrej Karpathy [text](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) and tutoring sessions with my supervisors I thought of posing a few pogramming challanges to my collegues or anyone else that want to solve pussles and discuss pros and cons.

The first challenge that I recon is a problem that can be solved either using a traditional software 1.0 paradigm using Python, Java c++ etc or by using Machine learning.

Challenge 1:
In this file there are locations represented by latitude and longitude and journeys (consiting of id for origin and destination)*. There exists a correlation between locations and journeys. Write a program that based on the information in the [first traning file](data.csv) outputs the correct journeys given the locations in this second test file [file](dataTest).

* Solution 1: [using fastai library](fastai.ipynb)

<hr>
**The first five numbers in a journey is the id for a origin station in [Sk√•ne/Sweden](http://labs.skanetrafiken.se/) and the last five is id for destination.*
